Module information:
    This module will serve as the entry point for the pipeline. It will either take sequence files stored on the local
    filesystem or a text file that contains the accession numbers and the name of the database from which to download 
    sequences from a public sequence repository.
    
    
    Future Objectives:
    
    Be able to download sequence files from the major public data repositories by simply checking the format of the
    accession numbers. 
    
    The goal is here is to create a package that can automate the preliminary phases of an RNA-Seq pipeline from raw 
    files to count tables.
